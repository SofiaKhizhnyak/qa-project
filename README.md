# Manual QA Project – Demo ECommerce Web App

This project demonstrates my practical QA skills through the complete testing process of a web application simulating an ecommerce platform.  
It showcases professional manual testing practices, structured documentation, and critical analysis of software behavior.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform a comprehensive manual testing cycle, including planning, execution, and reporting.  
The tested features include authentication (login  & signup), product browsing, cart management, and checkout flow.

## QA Methodologies & Skills Demonstrated
- **Functional Testing** – verifying that each feature works as intended according to the requirements.  
- **UI/UX Testing** – identifying usability and design issues that impact user experience.  
- **Exploratory Testing** – performing unscripted testing to uncover edge cases and hidden defects.  
- **Boundary & Input Validation Testing** – testing field limits, invalid data, and edge scenarios.  
- **Cross Browser and Mobile Responsiveness Testing** – ensuring the app behaves consistently across different devices and browsers.  
- **Bug Reporting & Severity Analysis** – documenting issues clearly, prioritizing based on impact & suggesting improvements.  
- **Test Documentation** – preparing professional QA deliverables such as:
  - Test Plan  
  - Test Cases  
  - Bug Reports  

## Deliverables
- `Test_Plan.pdf` – defines objectives, scope & testing strategy.  
- `Test_Cases.xlsx` – detailed step by step test cases with expected results.  
- `Bug_Reports.xlsx` – documented defects with reproduction steps and severity levels.  
- `Screenshots/` – visual evidence supporting test results.  

## Outcome
This project reflects my ability to apply QA methodologies in a structured and analytical way, identify critical defects and communicate findings clearly to stakeholders. 
It represents a complete manual QA workflow from planning to reporting.
